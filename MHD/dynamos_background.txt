I am an applied mathematician studying Sun's near surface shear layer (NSSL) and trying to understand if the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the NSSL drives the solar dynamo.  In collaboration with my PhD advisor, Daniel Lecoanet, I am running numerical simulations of the MRI using the Dedalus pseudospectral solver. In the near future, I will perform nonlinear optimization analyses of MRI simulations using an adjoint-looping technique to discover the initial conditions and parameters which yield solar-like simulations. I want to attend this workshop to familiarize myself with existing solar dynamo theories, so that I can optimize on quantities which are key ingredients of dynamo models.
