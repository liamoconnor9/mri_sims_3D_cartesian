MRI requires:
    - inwardly increasing angular velocity
    - weak nonlinear theory says: mri saturates
     by pushing the shear rate to its critical value 
     by rearranging velocity profiles
    - electrically conducting disks are linearly unstable 
     to weak-field mri (balbus and hawley)
    - keplerian shear can be unstable to turbulence
    - magnetic fields change the stability criterion:
     changes the stability criterion from a negative
     angular momentum gradient to a negative
     angular velocity gradient (density variations?)
    - stellar interiors have high magnetic and hydrodynamic
     reynolds numbers--still near the critical mri
     shear rate
    - mri can be axisymetric or not. the first unstable
     modes to appear are nonaxisymetric (3D)
    - at high instability, the fastest growing mode is 
     purely 2D

questions:
    - wavenumber of zero?
