Nonlinear instabilities in the sun's near surface shear layer (NSSL) might play a crucial role in driving the solar dynamo. Differential rotation in the NSSL is conducive to the magnetorotational instability (MRI), which has been shown to produce a self-sustaining dynamo when studied with optimized initial conditions. We have developed a tool to perform nonlinear optimization of initial conditions of MHD simulations. The optimization technique's objective function is completely arbitrary, allowing us to potentially reproduce aspects of the solar dynamo such as its cyclic period and spatial distribution. In this poster we demonstrate the viability and robustness of our optimization tool on simulations of the MRI in the solar context.
