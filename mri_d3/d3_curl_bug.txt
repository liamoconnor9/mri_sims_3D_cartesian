d3 curl bug:
- Everything works fine in serial with dealias = 1
- When either or both of those criteria are not satisfied, the bug is this:

- Defining omega as a substitution (line 44) and including curl(omega) in the PDE's RHS gives error
- If we move this term to the LHS, different error (singular matrix). Appending the laplacian term eliminates singular error.
- If we define omega as a problem variable instead of a substitution, no error.
